Usage of the adapter is pretty simple.
Plug in drives and SCSI cable before connecting the berg floppy to power.

* Plug 50-pin male into your usual 50 pin internal SCSI cable.
* It's critical to line up your powerbook (2.5 inch SCSI) drive such that the missing pin is where the little X mark is
* Install jumper J6
* Plug in the Berg Floppy connector

Connectors J3 and J4 are not necessary to install, they are bridges to pass through drive and motor power from another board I designed which most people won't have any use for.
