# Programming
You'll need something like a PicKit3 to program the PIC12F1840.  The MPLab Snap did not work for me at all, for unknown reasons.

# Usage
Plug in your favorite PS/2 keyboard and mouse (to the correct ports plese, see silkscreen label), plug in the ADB connector to your Mac, and you're done.

# Compatibility
The V1 design was tested on my Beige G3 and works fine.
