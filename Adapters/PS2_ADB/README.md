**Important Note
This V1 design has not been tested yet.  It's a modification of my tested and working v0.2 design, and is thus likely to work.  This disclaimer will be removed once testing on this PCB revision has been completed.

You'll need something like a PicKit3 to program the PIC12F1840 used here.  The MPLab Snap did not work for me at all, for unknown reasons.

** Usage
Plug in your favorite PS/2 keyboard and mouse (to the correct ports plese, see silkscreen label), plug in the ADB connector to your Mac, and you're done.

** Compatibility
The v0.2 design was tested on my Beige G3 and works fine.
