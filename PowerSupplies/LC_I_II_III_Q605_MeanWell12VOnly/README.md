This is a power supply replacement design for the LC I through III series plus Q605.  It uses a 12v MeanWell power supply which is then down-converted as necessary to provide the usual 12/5/-5 supply.  It's a working design, but too big of a pain to try and sell given the very small working area and cost which approaches a new old stock power supply replacement.  In the future when LC power supplies are entirely unavailble it might have some use.

This design uses the output pads layout from the "MacTX LC" which was released to the public domain.  Other than that it's an original design.
