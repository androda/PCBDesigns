This is a power supply replacement design for the LC I through III series plus Q605.  It uses a MeanWell RPT-60A power supply that provides the usual 12/5/-5, with this PCB being effectively a protection board to try and keep your vintage system safe in case of power surges or regulation failures.  It's a working design, just move over the power output cable from the original supply (which could need extending).

This design uses the output pads layout from the "MacTX LC" which was released to the public domain.  Other than that it's an original design.
