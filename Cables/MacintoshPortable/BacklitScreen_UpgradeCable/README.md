# Reproduction Screen Flex Cable For Backlight Upgrade of Original Macintosh Portable (M5120)
This is a reproduction flex screen cable for the original Macintosh Portable (M5120), which is used to upgrade it to the screen used by the backlit Macintosh Portable (M5126).

Note that this upgrade also *requires* the upgrade's original cable (to pull connectors from, for reuse) and the card which plugs into the ROM slot to power the backlight itself.  This cable by itself will not do the entire upgrade.

A prototype of this cable has been manufactured at AllPCB and tested on an original mac portable with the backlit screen upgrade setup.  The only difference between that cable and this design is fixing one missed ground connection, and the silkscreening.

AllPCB Settings:
180mm x 133mm
0.3mm min hole size
min 3 mil spacing
0.13mm FPC thickness
1oz copper (2oz would likely be better)
10um electromagnetic shielding

ENIG or hard gold plating are not necessary, as the originals don't come with that.  0.1mm PI stiffeners are recommended for the finger end connectors, 8mm deep and full edge connection width.  Also recommended to add PI stiffener to the other end where connectors go through the cable, for extra strength.

When plugging this cable into the display, make sure the pins are lined up - it may need to be shifted slightly, because this cable is not precisely the same width as the original.  It's close, but not exactly the same.

You are reminded that this design is offered without warranty of any kind, and is under a Non-Commercial-Use license.
