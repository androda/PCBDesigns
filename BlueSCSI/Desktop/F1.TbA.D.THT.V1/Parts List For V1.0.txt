Parts you will need to assemble:

* One STM32F103C8T6 "Blue Pill" board.  These are pretty widely available.  Follow the instructions in the BlueSCSI repo for setting up your Blue Pill board.

* One of this voltage regulator:
** LD1117V

* Two 110 ohm bussed resistor packs:
** Bourns 4610X-101-111LF

* A 120 Ohm through hole resistor (for position R2)

* A 154 Ohm through hole resistor (for position R1)

* A resistor of your choosing for position R3 (the LED current limiting resistor)
** I recommend 470 ohm to be safe across a wide range of LEDs

* Two Schottky diodes, for positions D1 and D2
** Diodes Incorporated SB130-T

* Four 10 uF 1206 (imperial size) ceramic capacitors
** Samsung CL31A106KOHNNNE is an option, among many others

* One 500mA continuous rated PTC fuse (position F1)
** Bel Fuse 0ZRR0050FF1E

* The MicroSD card slot, a Molex 105162-0001 such as:
** Mouser part number 538-105162-0001
** https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/1051620001/4555282

* Two position 2.54mm headers, plus a jumper for one

* Two 2x25 2.54mm male header rows OR a standard internal 50 pin SCSI port
** The label 'Notch' on the PCB is where the notch is located on a standard SCSI port
** OR if you're using header strips, 'Notch' is where the little locating prong from the SCSI plug goes
** I suggest using the actual SCSI port style, the built-in shroud makes it much harder to bend the connector pins

* The optional Berg Floppy Power Connector
** TE Connectivity 171826-4

The microSD slot and capacitors are the trickiest parts.  Capacitor pads were sized large enough to be hand-solderable relatively easily.
