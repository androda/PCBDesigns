Parts you will need to assemble:

* One STM32F103C8T6 "Blue Pill" board.  These are pretty widely available.  Follow the instructions in the BlueSCSI repo for setting up your Blue Pill board.
** https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill.html

* Two UCC56056DP chips, these are available new-old-stock from a few places

* Three 4.7uF capacitors, 0603 size

* Two 80k to 100k resistors (I used 90.9k), 0603 size

* The MicroSD card slot, a Molex 105162-0001 such as:
** Mouser part number 538-105162-0001

* Some 2.54mm header strip to split into 3-wide and two 4-wide segments

* 2.54mm jumpers

* One 40-pin 2x20 2.0mm right angle pin header.  I ordered these:

In addition, you will need something like solder paste, a hot air gun, tweezers... This isn't the easiest to assemble yourself without some tools because of the tiny 0603 parts.

If you are using metal mounting screws, print out the mounting screw gasket and put it under the screw which sits between the 5606 chips.
