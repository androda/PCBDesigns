Parts you will need to assemble:

* One STM32F103C8T6 "Blue Pill" board.  These are pretty widely available.  Follow the instructions in the BlueSCSI repo for setting up your Blue Pill board.

* One DPAK voltage regulator such as:

** Sipex AS1117R-2.85

* 18 110 ohm resistors, 0603 size, such as:

* Two capacitors of at least the required rating for your voltage regulator.  I used:

* The MicroSD card slot, a Molex 105162-0001 such as:
** Mouser part number 538-105162-0001
** https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/1051620001/4555282

* One two-position 2.54mm pin header such as:
** https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/sullins-connector-solutions/PRPC002SAAN-RC/2775252

* One three-position 2.54mm pin header such as:
** https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/metz-connect-usa-inc/PR20203VBNN/7794768

* One 40-pin 2x20 2.0mm right angle pin header.  I ordered these:
** https://www.ebay.com/itm/20pc-Pitch-2-0mm-2mm-90-Right-Angle-Male-Pin-Header-Dual-Row-2x20P-2x20-40P/133167939616

In addition, you will need something like solder paste, a hot air gun, tweezers... This isn't the easiest to assemble yourself without some tools because of those tiny 0603 resistors.
