Parts List for F1.TbA.MP.THT.V1

Through-hole parts:

0ZRR0050FF1E fuse, x1
SB130-T diodes, x1 (any schottky with 800mA+ rating ought to be fine)
LD1117V adjustable linear regulator x1
MFS1/4DCT52R1200F 120 ohm resistor for position R2, x1
MFR-25FBF52-154R 154 ohm resistor for position R1, x1
^  These resistor *values* are non-negotiable, but their physical sizing can differ
Two choices for termination resistors:
4610X-101-111LF 110 ohm resistor network, x2
OR
4610X-101-102LF 1000 ohm resistor network, x2
^ Both of these resistor types have worked in my testing.  It's a "short cable" situation so the smaller termination current works.
A 20 pin DIP chip socket, if you want termination to be switchable
34 pin connector, male 2x17 2.54mm.  Needs to be straight, not right-angle, to work with the cable.

Microcontroller Module:
STM32F103C8T6 "Blue Pill"
This is the one you want: https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F103C8T6-Blue-Pill
* Search Amazon or eBay for "STM32F103" but be *sure* it's the F103C8T6 because there are C6T6 versions floating around and those don't have enough program storage space.

Surface-Mount parts:
Three 1206 size 22uF capacitors, 10+ volt rating (higher voltage rating is better, I used 25V)
Molex 105162-0001 MicroSD Card Slot
