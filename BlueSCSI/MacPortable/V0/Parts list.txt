Parts you will need to assemble:

* One STM32F103C8T6 "Blue Pill" board.  These are pretty widely available.  Follow the instructions in the BlueSCSI repo for setting up your Blue Pill board.

* One 2.85v DPAK voltage regulator such as:

** Sipex AS1117R-2.85

* 18 110 ohm resistors, 0603 size, such as:

* Two capacitors of at least the required rating for your voltage regulator.  I used:

* The MicroSD card slot, a Molex 105162-0001 such as:
** Mouser part number 538-105162-0001
** https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/molex/1051620001/4555282

* A two-pin 2.54mm male header, with corresponding jumper

* A SOD-123F diode, pointing away from the two-pin jumper 

* A 34-pin male connector, two-rows of 17 pins at standard 2.54mm spacing
** Note the 'notch' indicator, that's where the notch in the connector goes

* A 34-pin female-female cable such as:

In addition, you will need something like solder paste, a hot air gun, tweezers... This isn't the easiest to assemble yourself without some tools because of those tiny 0603 resistors.
